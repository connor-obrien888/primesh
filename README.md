Implementation of [PRIME](https://github.com/connor-obrien888/prime) designed to predict magnetosheath conditions using solar wind time history from L1 monitors to generate predictions of near-Earth solar wind with uncertainties. For codes used to assemble figures from the paper, see `analysis.ipynb`. For usage examples, see `primesh_crib.ipynb`.
